📘 Pandas Series Practice – 129 Lines of Code
This project contains a complete hands-on practice of Pandas Series in Python. It covers all the essential operations and features required to master Series objects using the pandas library. The focus is purely on Series, not DataFrames.

📂 File Structure
series_practice.ipynb — Jupyter Notebook with all 129 lines of Pandas Series code

README.md — Project explanation and usage

✅ Topics Covered
The following Pandas Series concepts are included:

1. Creating Series
From lists, tuples, dictionaries

With custom index

Using NumPy arrays

2. Series Attributes
.index

.values

.dtype

.shape

.size

.ndim

3. Indexing and Slicing
Positional indexing []

Label-based indexing .loc[]

Conditional filtering

Boolean masks

Fancy indexing

4. Mathematical Operations
Addition, subtraction

Broadcasting

Vectorized operations

Aggregates: sum(), mean(), min(), max(), etc.

5. Functions and Methods
head(), tail()

sort_values(), sort_index()

value_counts(), unique(), nunique()

apply() and lambda functions

6. Handling Missing Values
isnull(), notnull()

fillna(), dropna()

7. Plotting with Series
Basic line plot

Bar plot using matplotlib / pandas.plot()

8. Other Operations
Membership testing (in, not in)

Type casting: astype()

Copying vs referencing

Using .get() method

Series from CSV columns (e.g. sampling movie names)

📌 Requirements
Python 3.x

pandas

numpy

matplotlib (for plotting)

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install pandas numpy matplotlib
🚀 How to Run
Open series_practice.ipynb in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Run each cell step by step to understand Series operations

Customize with your own data for deeper learning

📈 Sample Output
python
Copy
Edit
import pandas as pd

data = pd.Series([10, 20, 30, 40], index=['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'])
print(data)

# Output:
# a    10
# b    20
# c    30
# d    40
# dtype: int64
🧠 Learning Outcome
By completing this notebook, you'll understand:

What a Pandas Series is and how it's different from a DataFrame

How to manipulate, filter, and analyze Series data

How to plot Series using basic charts

How to prepare data for ML or visualization using Series-level operations



📂 Project Title:
Exploring Pandas DataFrame Functionality in Python

🧠 About:
This notebook focuses on practical implementation of various Pandas DataFrame functions in Python. After completing work on Pandas Series, this project continues the journey into DataFrames — covering creation, inspection, selection, modification, and useful built-in operations.

✅ Note: All Series-specific functions already covered in the previous notebook are excluded here.

📌 Topics Covered:
Creating DataFrames using lists, dictionaries, NumPy arrays

Reading and writing CSV/Excel files

Viewing and inspecting data:

.head(), .tail(), .info(), .describe(), .shape, .dtypes

Selecting data using:

loc[], iloc[], conditional filtering

Adding, renaming, and dropping columns

Updating values in a DataFrame

Sorting data using:

.sort_values(), .sort_index()

Handling missing data:

.isnull(), .notnull(), .fillna(), .dropna()

Grouping and aggregation:

.groupby(), .agg(), .mean(), .sum()

Merging, joining, and concatenating DataFrames

Applying functions using .apply() and lambda

Working with duplicate data

Exporting DataFrames back to files

🛠 Libraries Used:
Pandas

NumPy (where required)
